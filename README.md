Simulates stock market behavior by Agent Dynamics

A Zeroth approximation to my idea for simulating stock market behaviour by treating buyers & sellers as Agents:

We consider only 5 stocks, and randomly partition the population of buyers & sellers into 2 groups, which slowly change size. Starting with random initial demand & proposed supply for the two groups, we examine how the exchange evolves.
